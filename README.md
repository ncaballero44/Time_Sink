# Time_Sink
Software Engineering class term project at CSU Channel Islands. Collaborated with Aaron Jimenez, Jack Koscheka, and Jonathan Gomez. The app is a game in which the user sees how long they can hold down a button. There are several other features, including support for local multiplayer, achievements, and leaderboards. I personally implemented anti-cheating features as well as the achievements.

This repository was the one all group members committed their code to.
